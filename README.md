# 🎮 Sypher Engine – 2D Game Engine Built with LWJGL

Sypher Engine is a custom-built 2D game engine developed entirely from scratch using LWJGL(Lightweight Java Game Library).  
It combines the modularity and flexibility of Unity’s component-based architecture with the seamless live script editing experience inspired by Godot.  

Designed to provide a lightweight yet powerful foundation for creating 2D games in Java, Sypher Engine focuses on real-time iteration and ease of development.

## ✨ Features

### 🧱 Component-Based Architecture  
Inspired by Unity, Sypher Engine utilizes a modular system to construct reusable and extensible game behavior through components.

### 🖼️ Custom 2D Rendering Engine  
A fully OpenGL-powered rendering pipeline optimized for sprites, (tilemaps and 2D visual effects are in progress).

### 🧠 Dynamic Script Loading  
Java-based game logic scripts can be loaded and reloaded at runtime, allowing for live updates without requiring a restart of the engine.

### 📝 Embedded Script Editor  
Edit your game scripts directly inside the engine’s editor UI—no need to switch back and forth to external IDEs.
