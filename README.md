🎮 Sypher Engine – 2D Game Engine Built with LWJGL
Sypher Engine is a custom-built 2D game engine developed from scratch using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). It blends the flexibility of Unity's component-based architecture with Godot-style live script editing, providing a lightweight but powerful foundation for developing 2D games in Java.

✨ Features
🧱 Component-Based Architecture
Inspired by Unity, Sypher Engine uses a modular component system for building reusable and extensible game behavior.

🖼️ Custom 2D Rendering Engine
Built entirely on OpenGL through LWJGL, optimized for sprites, tiles, and 2D effects.

🧠 Dynamic Script Loading
Load and reload Java-based scripts at runtime, enabling live game logic updates without restarting the engine.

📝 Embedded Script Editor
Edit game scripts directly within the editor UI, similar to Godot—no need to switch to an external IDE.

🧪 In Progress
🔇 Audio System (Not Yet Implemented)
Sound and music playback features are planned for a future release.

💾 Dynamic Scene & Game Saving
In development: serialization and saving/loading of scenes, game state, and project data.

🎮 Play Mode / Editor Mode States
Separating runtime and edit-time behaviors to allow toggling between in-editor testing and scene editing.

📦 Texture Handling
Efficient texture loading and management system with support for atlases and OpenGL texture binding.

🧩 Scene and Entity Management
Hierarchical scene system with full support for nested entities and runtime editing.

🎨 Editor UX Enhancements
Current tools are functional; visual inspectors, drag-and-drop scene editing, and live previews are in development.

📦 Prefab and Asset System
Planned for easy reuse and instantiation of game objects and assets.
